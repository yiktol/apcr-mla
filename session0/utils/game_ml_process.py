    The ML development lifecycle typically includes these key phases:
    
    1. **Business Problem Framing**: Define the business problem and how ML can solve it
    2. **Data Collection & Integration**: Gather relevant data from various sources
    3. **Data Preparation & Analysis**: Clean, explore, and prepare data for modeling
    4. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features from raw data
    5. **Model Training & Tuning**: Train models and optimize hyperparameters
    6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance against business goals
    7. **Model Deployment**: Deploy models to production environments
    8. **Monitoring & Debugging**: Track model performance and handle issues
